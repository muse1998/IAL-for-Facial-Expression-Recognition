main.py -- contains the code of the proposed intensity-aware loss

modules.py -- contains the code of the proposed global convolution-attention block

video_transform.py \& dataset_DFEW.py -- contain the code of the data augmentation and the dynamic sampling strategy used in our methods

final_model.py -- is just used to build the overall model based on ''modules.py''
